                        Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in <strong>Tupelo, Mississippi</strong>. Raised in humble beginnings, he discovered a deep love for music early on, blending gospel, country, and rhythm & blues into a style all his own. In 1954, he recorded with Sun Records in Memphis, and by 1956, the world had taken notice.

                        Elvis’s iconic home, <strong>Graceland</strong> in Memphis, became a symbol of his stardom and legacy.

                        With hits like <em>“Hound Dog,”</em> <em>“Don't Be Cruel,”</em> and <em>“Jailhouse Rock,”</em> Elvis became the face of rock 'n' roll. His magnetic stage presence and hip-shaking dance moves made him a national sensation—and a controversy. In 1957, he purchased <strong>Graceland</strong>, the Memphis mansion that would become his sanctuary and a pilgrimage site for fans worldwide.

                        In the late 1960s and early 70s, Elvis staged a legendary comeback. He traded Hollywood for the stage and began his historic <strong>Las Vegas residency</strong> at the International Hotel in 1969. Dressed in rhinestone-studded jumpsuits, he became a Vegas icon, performing sold-out shows that blended rock, gospel, and heartfelt ballads.
