            <h2><u>Global and local variables</u></h2>
            <p>Global variables are a type of variable that will run the whole time whilst a program is active.
These type of variables are useful for variables that will be used thoughtout the whole program.

Local variables are variables that will not run the whole time during the duration of a program.
These are used for function and procedures and will die after they have being be used this saves RAM
allowing for the program to run quicker and more efficent </p>

            <h2><u> Functions and procedures</u></h2>
            <p>Functions are a type of modular programming these are like procedures but do return a value.

Procedures are the other type of modular programming these are like functions but don't. return a value

The benefits of using functions and procedurs is it allows you to use the same piece of code mutiple of times.
Without the need of copy and pasting the same thing over and over again which would reduce the file size size
of the program</p>

            <h2><u>Passing by value and passing by reference</u></h2>
            <p>Passing by value pass the direct value of a variable to a function/procedure
Passing by reference pass the location of the variable's value in memory to the function/procedure this allows for
the value of entered into the fucntion/procedure to change without having to call it with a diffrent value</p>

            <p>OOP is an another type of programming like procedual programming. OOP uses objects. Each object has it's own class.
The object is simply an instance of the class. The class can contain.</p>
